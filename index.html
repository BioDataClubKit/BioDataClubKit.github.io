     title: "What is BioData Club?"
     excerpt: "BioData Club is an informal and interdisciplinary co-learning initiative. We come together to share skills, ask questions, and learn about data science skills and open research tools. The model brings together learners starting from scratch (write your first line of code!) data science experts, and everyone in between to gain new data skills, troubleshoot projects, practice teaching in an informal context, and connect with other data and open science enthusiasts. <br><br>
The BioData Club Kit will help you start your own co-learning community! In addition to a website template, we’ve included a few of our most successful lessons, advice and resources for building a local co-learning club (we’ve leveraged a lot of good work from other organizations), and surveys for understanding your community's needs and goals.<br><br>"
