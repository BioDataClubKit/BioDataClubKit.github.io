As a community, we are all lifelong learners in BioData Club. This means that:

- We are all learning together
- We respect the presenter
- We give constructive feedback
- We help the presenter/teacher actively to improve their material

We believe that teaching about a subject is the best way to learn it. If you don't know anything about a subject, but you want to learn it, we can help you. Our network of learners will help you put your learning activity together, or if we're not familiar with the subject, we'll help you find someone who knows more.
